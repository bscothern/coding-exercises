* You can't use the fork button on github and then make a project private.
You have to instead manually clone it and make a repo in order to have the project private.

* Having the repo private makes it so you can't access the  locations.json   file without a token appended to your URL.
So making it public is better in order to avoid having people commit secret tokens to their code projects, especially since they have been instructed to make them public at the end of the challenge.
